Choosing between Kivy, PyQt, and Tkinter for future projects depends on several factors such as your specific needs, the type of application you are developing, and the level of community support or development activity you're looking for. Here's a breakdown of each framework to help guide your decision:

1. Kivy
Best for: Cross-platform, touch-based applications (including mobile)

Pros:

Cross-platform support: Kivy is designed to be cross-platform and works on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS. It’s ideal if you're looking to develop applications that need to run on both desktop and mobile devices.
Touch support: Kivy excels in creating touch-based applications (e.g., for mobile and tablets). It provides a rich set of touch gestures (e.g., swipe, pinch, zoom).
Modern UI: It allows for more modern and interactive user interfaces compared to older frameworks like Tkinter. You can create visually attractive and fluid UIs.
Active community and development: Kivy is actively maintained, and it has a growing user base.
Cons:

Learning curve: The framework’s layout system and design concepts might require a bit of a learning curve, especially for beginners.
Less native look and feel: Kivy apps tend to look more generic, and although you can customize the UI, it may not have the same "native" feel as applications built with frameworks like PyQt.
When to choose Kivy:

If you want to build cross-platform mobile apps (for both Android and iOS) as well as desktop apps.
If you're working with touch interfaces, animations, or need a modern UI.
2. PyQt
Best for: Desktop applications with a native look and feel

Pros:

Powerful and feature-rich: PyQt is a set of Python bindings for the Qt application framework, which is one of the most powerful and widely-used frameworks for developing desktop applications.
Native look: PyQt gives you a native desktop look and feel on all major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
Extensive functionality: PyQt includes everything from simple UI elements to advanced features like database integration, 2D graphics, and multithreading.
Good for complex applications: It is excellent for building desktop applications with complex UIs, including ones that require sophisticated windowing, forms, and controls.
Cons:

Larger learning curve: While Qt is powerful, it can be difficult for beginners due to its complexity.
Licensing: PyQt is available under the GPL license, but if you are developing a commercial application, you may need to purchase a commercial license from Riverbank Computing (the company behind PyQt).
Less cross-platform support for mobile: PyQt is primarily focused on desktop development and does not support mobile platforms as easily as Kivy does.
When to choose PyQt:

If you're focusing on building sophisticated desktop applications with a professional, native appearance.
If you're building apps with complex functionality or need access to advanced widgets and controls.
If your focus is primarily on desktop rather than mobile or web development.
3. Tkinter
Best for: Simple desktop applications or learning GUI development

Pros:

Ease of use: Tkinter is the standard Python library for creating desktop UIs. It's simple and well-suited for beginners. If you're just getting started with GUI development in Python, Tkinter provides an easy entry point.
Lightweight: It has a small footprint and is ideal for simple applications that don’t require too much functionality.
Integrated with Python: Tkinter is included with Python, so there’s no need to install additional packages to get started.
Cross-platform: Tkinter works on Windows, macOS, and Linux, though it’s primarily focused on desktop applications.
Cons:

Outdated look and feel: Tkinter’s UI components look quite dated compared to more modern frameworks like PyQt and Kivy. It lacks advanced UI components and customization options.
Limited for complex apps: It is not suitable for building large or complex applications, especially ones with intricate interfaces.
Not mobile-focused: Tkinter is designed only for desktop applications and doesn’t support mobile platforms.
When to choose Tkinter:

If you're just starting with GUI development and need a simple tool to create small desktop applications.
If you want to build a straightforward, lightweight desktop application without the need for a complex UI.
If you're building internal tools or simple utilities that don't need fancy features.
Comparison Summary
Framework	Best For	Pros	Cons
Kivy	Cross-platform (mobile & desktop)	Cross-platform (Android, iOS, desktop), touch support, modern UI	Less native look, higher learning curve
PyQt	Complex desktop applications	Native look, powerful features, modern UI	Larger learning curve, commercial license required for some apps
Tkinter	Simple desktop applications	Easy to learn, included with Python, lightweight	Outdated UI, limited features, no mobile support
